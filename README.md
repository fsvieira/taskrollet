# taskroulette

Task roulette is not a task manager, its a simple task helper that stores and chooses one and only one task per day for you to do.

# Features

* You can add as many tasks as you like at any time,
* You can only manage tasks when the task manager/list appear,
* You can't see your tasks, only the task of the day,
* Tasks are stored on you browser (localStorage) so no login needed,
